Basic Usage

CSS-JS-Booster is - as its name implies - divided into two functionblocks:
A CSS-optimizing block and a JavaScript-optimizing block.

For both functionalities you first need to include 
<?php include('booster/booster_inc.php'); ?>
at the top of your (PHP-interpreted) file. 

Should you happen to only have static HTML-files, try enabling PHP-parsing
by putting a .htaccess-file into the site's root with following directive:

AddType application/x-httpd-php .html .htm

Then go into the booster-folder and create a folder named "booster_cache"
and have it CHMOD 0777. 



For the CSS-part, put all releveant CSS-files into a subfolder "css" of your
site. Make sure, all declarations pointing to image-files have their paths
adjusted (i.e. all CSS should be fully functional inside that folder). 

If you have multiple CSS-files rename them so that they are alphabetically 
sorted in the desired order, e.g.:

01_first.css
02_second.css
03_third.css

Then add this declaration in the HTML's head-section:

<?php echo booster_css_markup(); ?>

for example:

<head>
<title>Webpage</title>
<?php echo booster_css_markup(); ?>
</head>



For the JS-part, put all releveant JS-files into a subfolder "js" of your
site. 

If you have multiple JS-files rename them so that they are alphabetically 
sorted in the desired order, e.g.:

01_first.js
02_second.js
03_third.js

Then add this declaration either in the HTML's head-section, or - better for
performance and therefore recommended when you experience no errors - right 
before the closing </body>:

<?php echo booster_js_markup(); ?>

for example:

<?php echo booster_js_markup(); ?>
</body>
</html>
